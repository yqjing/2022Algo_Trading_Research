## Title
A Dynamic Approach for Optimal Order Execution based on VWAP Benchmark using Stochastic Control by Y.Jing (2022)

## Abstract
We study the distribution of intraday market volume under the benchmark of VWAP. We
aim to increase the tracking fidelity of VWAP by improving the standard method used
in brokerage industry, in particular by incorporating the information coming from the
market during the trading in the best possible way. The assessing mechanism is defined
as minimising the RMSE of the slippage, with quadratic transaction costs. We assess the
method with a comprehensive simulation of trading on several most-traded indices in the
US. Our proposed solution, using a brand-new model for market volumes, reduces by 10%
the RMSE of VWAP tracking compared to the original solution and reduce transaction
costs by 21%.
