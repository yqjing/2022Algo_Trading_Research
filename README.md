## Title
A Dynamic Approach for Optimal Order Execution based on VWAP Benchmark using Stochastic Control by Y.Jing (2022)

## Abstract
We study the distribution of intraday market volume under the benchmark of VWAP.
Our objective is to increase the tracking fidelity of VWAP by improving the standard
method used in brokerage industry, in particular by incorporating the information coming
from the market during the trading in the best possible way. The assessing mechanism is
defined as minimising the RMSE of the slippage, with quadratic transaction costs. We
evaluate our method with extensive simulation of order execution on real Nasdaq-100
market data. Our proposed solution, using a new model for market volumes, reduces
by 10% the RMSE of VWAP tracking compared to the original solution and reduce
transaction costs by 21%.
